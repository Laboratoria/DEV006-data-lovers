## Prototypes and Iteration
During the development process, we created prototypes to test and refine our product's features and user interface. We conducted user testing on each prototype, which helped us gather feedback and insights from our target users. Based on this feedback, we iterated on our prototypes to improve the overall user experience.

### Low-fidelity prototype: 
Our first prototype was a wireframe. We used this prototype to get feedback on our overall concept and gather insights on how our target users might interact with our product.

### High-Fidelity Prototype: 
Our second prototype was a high-fidelity interactive prototype that closely resembled the final product. We used this prototype to test the product's usability and gather feedback on any remaining issues or areas for improvement.

### User Testing & Iteration
We conducted user testing on each prototype with a group of our target users, which were mainly young-adults. During each user testing session, we observed how users interacted with our prototypes and asked them to provide feedback on their experience. We used this feedback to identify any usability issues or areas for improvement.

Some of the issues that were found include: 
- Users found difficult to identify that they could return to Home with the top menu (an arrow for going back was added).
- When the going back arrow was included, sometimes they thought this will undo all changes, when it only went back to Home or back to Animations (this was later specifed on the button).
- The top menu font-size was not big enough (modified font-size). 

We repeated the user testing process for each iteration, which allowed us to validate our design decisions and ensure that our product was meeting the needs of our target users
