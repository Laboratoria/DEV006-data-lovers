          <h2>American adult animated television series created
            by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon in 2013 for Adult Swim, also
            aired on Cartoon Network. The series follows the misadventures of a
            scientist, Rick Sanchez, and his easily influenced grandson, Morty,
            who pass the time between domestic life and space travel,
            temporary and intergalactic. Dan Harmon, the co-creator of the series and
            Justin Roiland are responsible for the main voices of Morty and Rick,
            the series also includes the voices of Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and
            Sarah Chalke.

            The series originated from a scrappy short animated by Roiland
            for the Channel 102 film festival called Doc and Mharti, a parody of
            the main protagonists of Back to the Future. When NBC
            fired Harmon in 2013 over arguments between him and show executives
            he had created, Community, he and Roiland developed a series based on the
            characters already created by Roiland.</h2>
