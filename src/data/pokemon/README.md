This product has a designed and intuitive interface where it allows the user an easily accessible search through a search engine that filters by name and a button that executes the required search.
The interface also has a drop-down alphabetical list that allows us to order in ascending and descending order.
The screen shows cards where the user can view: the order number of each pokemon, name, type, weight and height of each pokemon.
The interface is designed to be viewed and manipulated on various devices, from desktop to different sizes of mobile screens.
