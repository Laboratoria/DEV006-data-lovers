      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Hayao Miyazaki was born in Tokyo in 1941. His childhood and youth were marked by the aftermath of the war. His mother laid sick in bed for nine years. His father and uncle ran a company that made rudders for airplanes. From an early age Miyazaki felt a special fascination for the world of aviation. His other great passion was drawing and in 1963, at the age of twenty-two, he started working at Toei Animation, the most important animated film studio in Japan. There he collaborated in series that became famous throughout the world such as Heidi, Marco and many others.
        Miyazaki dreamed of making another type of cinema, stories that would be capable of entertaining both parents and children. In 1985, together with his friend Isao Takahata, he founded the Ghibli studios, named after some Italian planes of that name that were used in the Sahara desert during World War II.</p>
